Event tracking app, you give an event and ppl give their time

General Idea:
1. User creates an event and sets available times.
2. User Gets link for event.
3. User shares link with other users.
4. Other users give their available times.
5. App shows everyone's times and the best time (time with most overlap).

Requirements:
- Some frontend (mobile, desktop, and/or web application).
- Some backend (just to keep everything synced).
- Some way to store data such that 2 ppl can send results without conflict SQL? JSON? text files?.
